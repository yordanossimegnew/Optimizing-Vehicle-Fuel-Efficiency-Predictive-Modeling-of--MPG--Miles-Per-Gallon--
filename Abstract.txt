This project delves into a comprehensive linear regression analysis of a dataset focusing on vehicle miles per gallon (MPG). The methodology encompasses a structured approach, beginning with data preprocessing steps such as standardizing column names, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. Following data preparation, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, comprising univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to gain insights into the relationships between variables. 

Subsequently, a linear regression model is trained on the dataset to predict MPG values, followed by model evaluation and visualization. The evaluation highlights the model's goodness of fit, as indicated by an (R^2) value of 0.821, signifying a strong correlation between predicted and actual MPG values. 

The scatter plot depicting actual versus predicted values illustrates a tight clustering around the diagonal line, indicating accurate predictions overall. However, analysis of residuals reveals outliers that warrant further investigation to refine model performance. Despite the model's effectiveness, opportunities for enhancement are identified, including fine-tuning, feature engineering, or exploring more complex models. 

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of linear regression in the context of vehicle MPG, offering implications for improving fuel efficiency and informing decision-making in the automotive industry.
